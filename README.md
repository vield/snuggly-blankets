This is a mini project I've wanted to do for ages.

There are a few crochet/knit pattern design tools online, but I've never seen anything very comprehensive, so I figured perhaps there would be space for one more...

The idea is to allow people to preview large projects (blankets, perhaps temperature blankets, jumpers, filet crochet items) without too much hassle.

There might also be some features to create "attractive" stripe or other random patterns.

I haven't used HTML5 canvas previously, but it's always nice to be able to add to my skillset ;)

Still would recommend processingJS for those just starting out with visualizations based on previous experiences.
